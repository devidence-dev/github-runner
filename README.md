# üèÉ GitHub Actions Self-Hosted Runner (Organization-Level)

This repository packages a containerized GitHub Actions self-hosted runner that registers at the **organization level**, making it available to all repositories within your GitHub organization.

## üéØ Purpose
- Provide a Docker image and docker-compose orchestration to run a self-hosted GitHub Actions runner
- Register the runner at **organization level** (not tied to a specific repository)
- Allow any repository in your organization to use this runner

## üì¶ Primary files
- `Dockerfile` ‚Äî Image definition with configurable runner version (ARG RUNNER_VERSION)
- `docker-compose.yml` ‚Äî Orchestration for running the container
- `start.sh` ‚Äî Container entrypoint that handles registration at org-level and runner lifecycle
- `.env.example` ‚Äî Example environment variables
- `.gitignore` ‚Äî Prevents committing secrets and build artifacts

## üöÄ Quick start

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Copy and configure environment file

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Edit `.env` and set **required** variables:

- `GH_OWNER` ‚Äî Your GitHub **organization name** (required)
- `GH_TOKEN` ‚Äî Personal Access Token with **admin:org** scope (required for org-level runners)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: For organization-level runners, your token needs the `admin:org` scope, not just `repo`.

### ‚úÖ Environment variables

**Required:**
- `GH_OWNER` ‚Äî GitHub organization name (required)
- `GH_TOKEN` ‚Äî Personal Access Token with `admin:org` scope (required)

**Optional:**
- `RUNNER_NAME` ‚Äî Friendly name for the runner (default: `raspi-runner-<timestamp>`)
- `RUNNER_DATA` ‚Äî Path to persist runner data (default: `./runner-data`)
- `REGISTRATION_TOKEN` ‚Äî Manual registration token (if automatic retrieval fails)
- `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` ‚Äî For optional notifications

> üìù **Note**: `GH_REPOSITORY` is **not needed** for organization-level runners

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Example `.env` configuration:

```bash
# GitHub organization configuration
GH_OWNER=your-organization-name
GH_TOKEN=ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

# Runner configuration
RUNNER_NAME=org-runner-01
RUNNER_DATA=./runner-data

# Optional: manual registration token
# REGISTRATION_TOKEN=your_manual_token_here

# Optional: Telegram notifications
# TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token_here
# TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=your_chat_id_here
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Build and run

```bash
# Build and start the runner
docker-compose up -d

# Follow logs to verify registration
docker-compose logs -f github-runner
```

You should see:
```
‚úÖ Runner configured successfully
üèÉ Starting runner...
```

## üìã Behavior notes

- The runner registers at **organization level** using the GitHub API endpoint `/orgs/{org}/actions/runners/registration-token`
- `start.sh` automatically obtains a registration token using `GH_TOKEN`
- The runner will be available to **all repositories** in your organization
- If automatic token retrieval fails, you can set `REGISTRATION_TOKEN` manually in `.env`
- Runner version can be customized at build time: `docker build --build-arg RUNNER_VERSION=2.329.0 .`

## üîí Security

- **Never commit** `.env` or tokens to the repository (`.gitignore` prevents this)
- Use a token with minimal required scope: `admin:org` for organization runners
- The runner runs in an isolated Docker container with controlled access

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Runner doesn't register
- Check logs: `docker-compose logs -f github-runner`
- Verify `GH_TOKEN` has `admin:org` scope (not just `repo`)
- Confirm `GH_OWNER` is the **organization name**, not a username
- Check that your organization allows self-hosted runners

### Docker permission errors
- Ensure the host user can access Docker socket
- Verify the container runs with appropriate privileges (privileged: true in docker-compose.yml)

### Token issues
- Generate a new token at: GitHub ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Developer settings ‚Üí Personal access tokens
- Required scope: `admin:org` for organization-level runners
- Token must belong to a user with admin access to the organization
